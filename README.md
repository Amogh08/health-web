Project Title: Health-Web: A Health Assistance Chatbot

Problem Statement/Opportunity:
People who need immediate health-related information and people having minor health symptoms often don't want to consult a doctor as it costs time and money but they need someone to talk and assist them. A Health Assistance Chatbot can help with this problem.

Project Description:

The project is a chatbot deployed on a website and connected to a knowledge base. People will be able to get assistance by talking to it. It will be helpful to people who need to get their health-related queries resolved. It will also assist people with small health-related problems. People will be able to educate themselves about diseases, their precautions and treatment. This will save the doctors' and patients' time in resolving small queries so that doctors can focus on patients having severe diseases.
